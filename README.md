# Calculator-VLSM-and-IPV4

I make IPv4 and VLSM calaculator 
IPv4 calaculator can calc network address maximum hosts in network and broadcast address
EXAMPLE 

- address IP == 192.168.0.1
- Mask == 255.255.255.0
so calc calculates network address and broadcast address 
- network address == 192.168.0.0
- broadcast address == 192.168.0.255
- hosts == 254
 
VLSM calculates subnet is calculates from hosts and netmask 
EXAMPLE 

Why need 30 hosts in network and we have IP address so:

- hosts == 30
- IP address == 192.168.0.1

- SUBNET == 192.168.0.0--192.168.0.63
